This directory contains regression test pairs for SST.

A regression test log is just a command capture from a game or partial
game, with a QUIT appended to tell it to exit a partial game.  The
corresponding check file is just the output stimulated by the log.
All files with extension ".log" in this directory will be treated as
test logs, with each corresponding checkfile having extension ".chk".

"make regress" checks that the output of the logfiles is stable. It
will show context diffs when the actual output is different from the
checkfile.

"make buildregress" rebuilds all check files from their logs.

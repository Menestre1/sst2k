Stas Sergeev story:

Found Tom Almy's C sources - yeah! Hmm, not too playable - I've got
used to that nice text-based GUI I've seen on an IBM S/370 port, and the
command-line control gets me quite annoyed. But that's a good starting
point for some improvements - the sources are finally here! I was about
to start writing an S/370 emulator to get it a go, and now here are
the sources - what a great finding.

[a bit later]

Added a text-based interface which makes the game much more playable.
Initially I made it for DOS using conio.h. Later I decided to make a
linux port, and I ported it using a linux-conio package. I had to patch
linux-conio a lot, so you have to use my version. The colors are still
wrong though.
I also fixed an uncountable amount of bugs and added some features, I
can't remember now which ones.

[3 years later]

I dusted off the game and finally got around to move it to autoconf.
For building with Borland C under DOS, use the build_bc.bat file.

It turned out Tom Almy also did a linux port and made some bug-fixing
work, although to the much smaller extent than I did. I contacted him
and notified about my port, but he expressed no interest. :(

[a year later]

I've found out that Eric S Raymond (ESR) took over the development
of the Tom Almy's sources. He could use mine instead as they are
much more advanced, but oh well... Now I have to find out the way
to incorporate my mods into his version and hope that he can do
the better work on that game than I could (which is most likely
the case).
.....
OK, the changes were incorporated, however Eric removed the conio
port and therefore the game can no longer be compiled with bcc/DOS.
The DJGPP port might still be possible in the future.
